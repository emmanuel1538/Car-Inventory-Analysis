# Car-Inventory-Analysis
## INTRODUCTION
This project is to display my data cleaning, transformation and visualization skill using Excel. This is an Excel project on sales analysis of an imaginary Car Retail Store called HireHawks Motors.
### Disclaimer: 
All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution, or country, but are just dummy datasets to demonstrate my capabilities in Excel.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
I was presented with a car dealership's inventory dataset. The data is not formatted ideally, with the car ID squeezed into a single cell and color information potentially spread across multiple columns. The Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) wants to leverage this data for marketing purposes and needs insights into the car inventory.
## SKILLS AND CONCEPT DEMONSTRATED
The following Excel features were incorporated:
* Creating new columns
* Use of Text Functions
* Removing duplicates
* Sorting data
* Creating Lookup Table
* Pivot tables
* Data Visualization
## DATA SOURCE
Dummy data Set I got on GitHub.
### Data Description:
*	The dataset includes information about the car dealership's inventory.
*	Columns include:
  + carId (combined car identifier, needs processing)
  + Make (extract the make of the car)
  + Make (Full Name)
  + Model (extract the model of the car)
  + Model (Full Name)
  + Manufacture Year
  + Miles/year
  + Warranty Miles covered and not covered
### ADDITIONAL CAR DETAILS 
#### CAR MAKE 
*	FD	Ford
*	CR	Chryster
*	GM	General motors
*	HO	Honda
*	HY	Hyundai
*	TY	Toyota


#### CAR MODEL 
          Model	full name

*	CAM	Camry
*	CAR	Caravan
*	CIV	Civic
*	CMR	Camero
*	COR	Corolla
*	ELA	Elantra
*	FCS	Focus
*	MTG	Mustang
*	ODY	Odessy
*	PTC	PT cruiser
*	SLV	Silverado

## Tasks:
### 1.	Data Cleaning and Formatting:
+	Extract the car ID information from the carId column into separate columns for Make, Model, and Manufacture Year.
+	Handle potential inconsistencies or missing data in the extracted columns.
+	Remove duplicates, handling duplicates.


### 2.	Data Analysis:
+	Calculate the current age of each car.
+	Calculate the average miles driven per year for each car.
+	Identify cars still under warranty based on Warranty Miles and current mileage.
+	Develop a new unique car ID for the CMO by concatenating the first three letters (uppercase) of Make, Model, Manufacture Year, and the first three letters (uppercase) of the primary Color.


### 3.	Data Visualization:
* Create visualizations to show:
  + Total number of cars in the inventory.
  + Breakdown of cars by model and make (potentially a stacked bar chart).
  + Total miles driven by car model (potentially a bar chart).
  + Warranty coverage status by car model (potentially a pie chart or bar chart).
  + Distribution of car colors by make (potentially a stacked bar chart).
### 4.	Additional Analysis:
*	Identify the top 5 car models with the highest total mileage driven.
*	Find the oldest and youngest car in the inventory based on Manufacture Year.
